# Project Progress & Development Guidelines

## Current Status

We have implemented a Clean Architecture API service with the following components:

- **Core domain entities** (User, Note)
- **Repository interfaces** with both SQLAlchemy and in-memory implementations
- **Service interfaces** for authentication (JWT) and caching (Redis)
- **Use case implementations** for business logic
- **FastAPI routes** for REST API endpoints
- **Comprehensive tests** for domain models, repositories, and API endpoints
- **End-to-end test script** for API functionality

The application now has a functional implementation with all core features working:
- User registration and authentication (JWT)
- Note CRUD operations with proper persistence
- Clean Architecture layering with dependency inversion
- Proper transaction management in SQLAlchemy repositories

Ready for further enhancements:
- Production deployment configuration
- Additional features like rate limiting

## Architecture Guidelines

### Clean Architecture Principles

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies should only point inward
   - Core domain must not depend on outer layers
   - Use interfaces for cross-layer communication

2. **Layer Responsibilities**:
   - `core`: Domain entities, interfaces, DTOs (no dependencies on outer layers)
   - `application`: Use case orchestration (depends only on core)
   - `infrastructure`: Implementation details (depends on core interfaces)
   - `api`: Delivery mechanism (depends on application and infrastructure)

3. **Folder Structure**: Follow the established pattern when adding new features:
   ```
   src/
   ├── core/              # Domain entities, interfaces, DTOs
   ├── application/       # Use case implementation
   ├── infrastructure/    # External interfaces implementation
   └── api/               # FastAPI routes and dependencies
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. Start by defining the **domain model** in `core/domain/`
2. Create **repository interface** in `core/repositories/`
3. Define **DTOs** in `core/use_cases/`
4. Implement **use cases** in `application/use_cases/`
5. Create **repository implementations** in `infrastructure/persistence/`
6. Add **API routes** in `api/routes/`
7. Write **tests** for each layer

### Coding Standards

- Use **type hints** throughout the codebase
- Follow **PEP 8** conventions with 100 character line limit
- Prefer **composition** over inheritance
- Implement unit tests for each component
- Document public functions and classes with docstrings

### Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Raise domain-specific exceptions in the application layer
   - Convert exceptions to HTTP responses in the API layer
   - Log all exceptions with appropriate context

2. **Testing**:
   - Unit test domain entities and use cases in isolation
   - Use in-memory repositories for service-level tests
   - Use FastAPI test client for integration tests

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Use FastAPI's dependency injection system
   - Configure dependencies in `api/dependencies.py`
   - Invert dependencies to follow Clean Architecture

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Add comprehensive tests for all components
2. ✅ Fix transaction management in repositories
3. Implement API documentation with proper examples
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Add logging and monitoring
6. Implement additional features:
   - User roles and permissions
   - Rate limiting
   - Pagination for list endpoints
   - Search and filtering
   - Swagger UI customization
7. Clean up development files and add documentation

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

1. **Transaction Management**: Fixed the SQLAlchemy repositories to properly commit transactions instead of just flushing them.
   - Changed `session.flush()` to `session.commit()` in all repository methods
   - Enhanced session management in FastAPI dependency injection
   - Ensured proper rollback on exceptions

2. **End-to-End Testing**: Implemented comprehensive test script that verifies all API operations:
   - User creation and authentication
   - Note CRUD operations
   - User listing
   - Proper error handling
